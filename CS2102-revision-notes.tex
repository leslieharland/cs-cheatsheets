Sometimes, a constraint forces us to have circular references.  In that case, there are several ways to solve this two of which are shown below:
\\
Completely break the circularity and ignore certain constraints.
If you wish, you can recover the circularity via ALTER TABLE.

Likes all pizza sold by a restaurant\\
If restaurants has pizza A and B\\
customers likes A, B, C\\
this subset should be still be included

\subsection*{Universal Quantification}
\textbf{Intuition}
\\
$|P_{1}| \geq |P_{2}| for \{1, 2, 3\} \not\subset \{4, 5\}$
$S1 \cup S = S1$ when S1 already contains S
$S1 \cap S$ = S
as they are incomparable
\\\\
\textbf{Double negation}
There is no pizza sold by CC where not (P likes pizza) 
\subsection*{Functional Dependencies}
\textbf{Reflexivity}\\
AB $\rightarrow$ A 
\\\\
\textbf{Composition}\\
A $\rightarrow$ B \\
C $\rightarrow$ D \\
AC $\rightarrow$ BD \\
\\
\\
\textbf{Logical implication}\\
Does it hold for all instances in the table
\\\\
If FD is R(A, B, C, D)\\
then total number of FDs is (2^4 - 1) $\times$  ($2^4$ - 1)\\
excluding itself so -1\\
\\
A $\rightarrow$ BC is also A $\rightarrow$ B and A $\rightarrow $C
\\\\
Attribute redundancy\\
AB $\rightarrow$ C and B $\rightarrow$ A
\\
We can replace AB $\rightarrow$ C with A $\rightarrow$ C
\\
\\
FD redundancy - remove without changing its meaning\\
A $\rightarrow$ B and B $\rightarrow$ C means A $\rightarrow$ C is redundant\\
For each FD, check for every single node on the destination and if there is a path from source to destination
\\
minimum cover is not unique
\\
\\
\textbf{How to get attribute closure}\\
For e.g. AD+ = ACDE\\\\

\includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/ss}
\\
Using the hyper-graph connect the source to the nodes at the left side of the implication\\
- Is there a path that can reach the nodes given at the right side of the implication
\\\\
\textbf{How to get minimal cover}\\
Usually the implications that can't be decomposed\\\\
Cannot have redundant attributes\\
AB $\rightarrow$ CDE\\
B+ check if B can determine CDE\\
which means A is redundant\\
B $\rightarrow$ CDE
\\\\
\textbf{How to get key}\\
If there is no arrow pointing to them in the hyper-graph, we need to include it as part of the key\\
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/sss}
\\
Given a superkey
CDG+\\
Then try all combinations\\
CD+ CG+ DG+\\
Find attributes that is missing from the rhs
\subsection*{Decomposition}
Intuition is like splitting the relation into two or more\\\\
\textbf{Lossless join}\\\\
If the relation only contain attributes on RHS most likely it is not lossless
\\
$F \models (R1 \cap R2)$ satisfy a FD\\
1. Combine two relations into one using same attribute\\
2. Each R can only be used one in the tree\\\\
Alternatively, calculate closure on that attribute, all attributes that it leads to \\
Eg E+ $\rightarrow$ BDE 
\\\\
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/s1.png}
\\\\
\textbf{Dependency preserving}\\
Assuming fd are non-trivial, check if all LHS are satisfied by 
Cannot include anything that is trivial\\\\
As long it satisfy one of the attribute on LHS, then the FD is satisfied. Can use the output to another FD.\\\\

Does R1 contain the attributes that is described by any FD?\\
